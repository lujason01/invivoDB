# invivoDB: a highly curated database for invivo data for insilico animal digital twins.

![](images/mousemovie1.gif.gif)

## **What?**
An application for research animal digital twins. This is intended to be a well-curated database of in vivo experimental data. 

## **Use Case**
Curated in vivo data for prediction models and Insilico digital twins.  

## **Objectives:**

- Develop a file format and standards for reusable data in therapies. 
- Categorise therapies by gene therapy vector or by therapeutic approach (Mechanism of Action, MOA), eg Immunocytokines, Cell cycle targeting, etc
- Tests or Assays performed per experimental unit (Animals) following best practices of animal welfare.
- Assign accession numbers to experimental units. 
- Organised by species. 

## Proposed Value: 

- A catalogue of well-curated in vivo datasets for drug discovery.
- For training predictive machine-learning models (Data is King)
- Incentivise the biomedical space to adopt standardised curation and data reporting (Both academia and Industry).

*I am a novice programmer therefore, I'd need some mentorship and support from experienced devs to maintain and develop this much needed tool in the lifesciences.*

### Open call to contribute
This is a project in progress and we are counting on everyone to making this Database better. 
Contributors can feature this project on their portfolio.
